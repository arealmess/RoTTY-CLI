This is my first C# project, ported from a python script. At one time it used a soft float library, and another it used BigDecimal

What it does is takes four # inputs in the format a,b,c,d which become the initial conditions for an internal double pendulum/solar system

Every time both pendulum arms align, it logs the position in degrees, which you can toggle to map to a letter dial

The idea was that with the right initial conditions you could have it type any sentence. Thanks for checking it out :]
